        <h1>About</h1>
        <div>
            <p>Hello, I'm a 27-year-old tech enthusiast who embarked on a journey into the world of technology a few years back. I'm fueled by a deep passion and unwavering motivation for what I doâ€”I'm the type of person who voraciously consumes information to acquire new knowledge and skills. While I primarily identify as a developer, I also have a penchant for outdoor pursuits such as hiking, skateboarding, and hosting barbecues. Moreover, I cherish my indoor activities, including playing the bass, immersing myself in books, and nurturing my artistic side through drawing. And last but not least, cats hold a special place in my heart as my favorite companions.</p>
