                Hello 👋, first of all, thank you for visiting my website. I started programming some years ago and have had multiple experiences throughout my career, working as an RPA Developer, Business Analyst, and Web Developer. I’m really interested in learning different skills, and my main focus is Web Development.
                <br><br>
                Currently, I’m working as a freelancer, focusing on RPA and Web Development. This is a project aside from my main job (which I’m currently searching for). I’ve collaborated with great teams in my past roles. I’m flexible, have good communication skills, and love exchanging knowledge.
                <br><br>
                Below are my technical skills and work experience. If you’d like to reach out, feel free to call, email, or add me on Discord.
            </p>
