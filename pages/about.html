      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm a 26-year-old tech enthusiast who embarked on a journey into the world of technology
        a few years back. I'm fueled by a deep passion and unwavering motivation for what I doâ€”I'm the type of person
        who voraciously consumes
        information to acquire new knowledge and skills. While I primarily identify as a developer, I also have a
        penchant for outdoor pursuits
        such as hiking, skateboarding, and hosting barbecues. Moreover, I cherish my indoor activities, including
        playing the bass, immersing myself
        in books, and nurturing my artistic side through drawing. And last but not least, cats hold a special place in
        my heart as my favorite companions.</p>
